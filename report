🔐 SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

Checks whether the mail server sending the email is authorized by the domain owner.

If the email claims to come from shipping-alerts.info but the server isn’t on the allowed list, SPF will fail.

✉️ DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

Adds a cryptographic signature to emails so the receiver can verify that:

The email truly came from the claimed domain, and

The content wasn’t altered in transit.
Phishing emails often lack a valid DKIM signature.

📘 DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

Uses both SPF and DKIM results to decide what to do with suspicious emails:

Reject, quarantine, or allow them.
Legitimate domains configure DMARC to prevent spoofing; phishing domains often don’t.
